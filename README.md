# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
In this project, I have done some Natural Language Processing on the Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset, which contains data for over 14000 tweets. Then I have used several classifiers namely, Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Decision Trees to predict the sentiment of the tweet i.e. positive, negative or neutral.

### Accuracy:
Multinomial Naive Bayes: 77.16%

Random Forest: 73.60%

Decision Tree: 68.36%

SVM: 63%
